                        My name is Adam Ali, and I'm 20 years old. I was born in
                        Spain but also have Ukrainian roots. Growing up, my
                        family and I moved between Spain and Ukraine quite
                        frequently. When I was 11, we settled in Ukraine.
                        Unfortunately, due to the war that began in 2022, we
                        were forced to leave the country. We sought refuge in
                        Spain, where we stayed for 8 months. During that time,
                        we considered relocating to Canada, so we applied for a
                        visa and waited. In early 2023, we made the move to
                        Canada, where I currently reside.

                    <p>
                        As a child, I was fascinated by video games and dreamt
                        of becoming a video game programmer. I made my first
                        attempts to learn programming at the ages of 12 and 14,
                        but I struggled to make progress. However, everything
                        changed when I turned 16 and discovered my passion for
                        web development. I started learning the basics and found
                        myself captivated by the world of web programming.

                        Although I can't pinpoint exactly why, I felt drawn to
                        combining programming with content creation. I dedicated
                        a year to studying, but progress was slow as I juggled
                        my studies with preparing for final exams during my last
                        year of high school in Ukraine. After a summer break in
                        Spain, I reignited my passion for web programming and
                        delved into more advanced topics, such as JavaScript
                        frameworks, version control, and design software. This
                        journey was entirely self-directed. I relied on YouTube
                        courses, tutorials, and lots of practice to hone my
                        skills.

                        I don't have industrial experience or have not worked in
                        a company yet. However, I have completed several
                        projects, which I share on this page. These projects
                        showcase my experience and skills in web development. I
                        am currently looking for job opportunities in the field
                        to gain more experience.

                        Essentially, I am looking for a job, but in the
                        meantime, I am doing other things. I am updating the
                        design of my projects because some of them no longer
                        meet my standards. Soon, you will see them improved. I
                        am also learning new technologies to enhance my skills.
                        Recently, I learned TypeScript, and I plan to learn
                        Next.js as well. After this and some backend learning, I
                        will develop more projects to solve common problems that
                        I and people around me face.

                        ambitious goals that I'm determined to achieveâ€”building
                        this website was one of them. Beyond that, I strive to
                        treat everyone with respect and equality. Lastly, I'm
                        passionate about helping others grow and succeed. If you
                        have any questions or projects in mind, I'm here to
                        assist you in any way I can.
